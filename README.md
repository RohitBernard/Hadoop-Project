# Hadoop-Project
Our project aims at mining a Social Media Dataset to find the connected users. Using the concept of MapReduce we try to solve this problem.When given a large dataset related to social media, it is really hard to find connected users, their interests, etc.
 
In this project, given a dataset (social media) can be used to find the connected users. The results can be further used to drive some promotion of ads, suggest friends or relevant events, etc.
